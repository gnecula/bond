# Bond

For more about Bond and usage instructions, see the main [documentation page](http://necula01.github.io/bond/).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rbond'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rbond

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. 

API documentation is built using YARD; simply running `yard` will generate the documentation. However, for the full suite of documentation including examples, you should build from the project main directory (one level up), which will generate and integrate YARD documentation. 

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
