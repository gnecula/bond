Generating documentation
---------------------------

You must install Sphinx (``pip install -U Sphinx``) and then

.. code::

    cd docs
    make html


Running tests
-----------------

The best way to run tests is from PyCharm. Just right-click in the body of a test, and you can select "Debug test..."

To run all the tests from the command line:

.. code::

   pybond> [BOND_MERGE=...] make run_tests
